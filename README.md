# Higher-Lower-Python-Game
This repository contains a Python program where users can play a "Higher Lower" game inspired by social media follower counts. Players compare the number of followers between two randomly selected accounts and guess which one has more followers. The game ends when a wrong guess is made, and the final score is displayed.
